# **GitHub Repositories With Search Functionality**

## Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Specs

**GitHub Repositories With Search Functionality**
Nothing out of this world here — GitHub repositories are basically just a glorified list.

The task is to allow the user to type in the name of a github user and display his/her repositories in a list. The user should then be allowed to filter through the repositories by name and/or programming language.

The interface doesn’t need to be unique; feel free to take inspiration from your favourite apps or even the Github interface itself. We would like to see a responsive interface that follows good user experience principles. (As an example of what we mean by this, check out [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/).)
Use the [official GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to fetch repositories per user.

### Requirements

- The application must be written using React
- Use typescript
- You are required to use git for versioning
- Feel free to use any additional plugin/module to help you get the task done more
effectively
- Google Chrome is the testing browser

### Extra credits

Things that are not mandatory, but we would like to see:

- +1 if you add storybook and divide the components
- +1 if you write tests
- +1 if deploy it somewhere (like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/))
- +1 If your [code is documented](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#jsdoc)
- +1 If you’re up for the challenge, use the [v4 API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql), which is built using GraphQL.
- +1 If you write a README that includes
    - A short description about the project
    - Instructions on how to run it
    - Instructions on how to run the test suite
    - Future improvements
